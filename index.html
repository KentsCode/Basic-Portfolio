	<p>My name is Kenneth Prettman. Most people call me Kent. I currently live in Des Plaines, IL. I have lived there for 10 years and prior to that I lived in Schaumburg for 20 years. I recently took a trip to Germany where I got to see a castle for the first time. The picture of me standing in a doorway was taken at Burghausen Castle.</p>

	<p>I enjoy riding my motorcycle. I have an SV650 but I want an Aprillia Tuono RSV4. Hopefully when I am making some of that sweet web developer money I can afford one and a place with a garage to store it. My poor SV650 has to sit outside under a cover during the summer but I keep it in a garage during the winter.</p>
